# Columbia-Housing-Calculator

Goes through Columbia's publicly available housing data (http://housing.columbia.edu/announcement/room-selection-lottery-numbers-now-available-0) and uni data (https://directory.columbia.edu/people/) and orders groups based on their respective sizes (ranging from 1 to 8). 

Helps students know where they stand when it comes to housing selection.  Knowing how many groups of X size are before you can help you calculate what housing options are still feasible.
